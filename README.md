# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python
Project Overview: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
Objective:
This project is focused on predicting medical insurance costs using a machine learning model. By harnessing features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and more, the primary goal is to develop a model capable of accurately estimating insurance expenses.

Key Components:

Importing the Dependencies:

Set up the necessary libraries and tools for the project.
Data Collection & Analysis:

Explore and understand the structure of the medical insurance dataset.
Identify key variables and obtain summary statistics.
Categorical Features:

Analyze and process categorical features within the dataset.
Data Analysis:

Perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
Distribution of Dataset:

Visualize the distribution of insurance costs and key features.
Univariate Analysis:

Analyze individual variables to gain deeper insights.
Data Pre-Processing:

Handle missing values and preprocess the data for modeling.
Encoding Categorical Features:

Transform categorical features into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Splitting the Features & Target:

Separate the features and target variable for model training.
Splitting Data to Training Data & Testing Data:

Divide the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Training:

Select and train machine learning algorithms suitable for regression.
Linear Regression:

Implement and evaluate a linear regression model.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's predictive performance on both training and testing data.
Prediction on Training Data:

Generate predictions on the training dataset.
Prediction on Test Data:

Make predictions on the test dataset.
Building a Predictive System:

Develop a predictive system for estimating medical insurance costs.
Documentation:
Document the entire process, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook contains code, visualizations, and explanations for each stage of the project.
